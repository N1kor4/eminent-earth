## Lycée Chateaubriand, Rennes

After obtaining my high school diploma (BAC) with highest honors, I followed the advice of my physics and math teachers to enter the demanding world of **Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles (CPGE)**.

Arriving with confidence, since I had passed the BAC fairly easily, I soon hit what students call the *“prépa wall”*. The pace, workload, and expectations were far beyond anything I had known before. It was the beginning of an intense two-year experience that left me with lasting memories — both challenging and rewarding.

### Choosing the path

I had the choice between Chateaubriand in Rennes and Clémenceau in Nantes, both close to home. Initially, I wanted to pursue the **PSI (Physics and Engineering Science)** track, which was better ranked, and one of my best friends made the same choice. However, I ultimately joined the **PC (Physics-Chemistry)** track, which better aligned with my strengths and interests.  

Preparatory classes are demanding but push students to always aim higher. At the same time, I realized that smaller, specialized schools are sometimes undervalued in favor of larger institutions that primarily train managers rather than experts (for example, Centrale).

### Life in prépa

The rhythm was intense: a dense curriculum, daily work, and even exams on Saturday mornings. The focus was largely theoretical, but labs and **TIPE projects** provided a more applied dimension.  

There are also “star classes,” which group the top students from first-year tracks. I narrowly missed being placed in one (by just two ranks out of 24), and in hindsight, I’m glad. Being in a slightly less competitive environment allowed me to perform better, express my knowledge with more confidence, and enjoy a more supportive atmosphere.

### Projects (TIPE)

TIPE (*Travaux d’Initiative Personnelle Encadrés*) was one of the most enriching aspects of the CPGE program. I worked on:  

- **Superconductive train** — a project exploring the principles of magnetic levitation using superconductors.  
- **Autocleaning glass** — an investigation into how water droplets interact with surfaces, and how nanostructures can create self-cleaning materials.  

These projects gave me my first taste of **applied physics and materials science**, bridging the gap between abstract theory and real-world applications.

### Outcome

In the end, I entered **Phelma – Grenoble INP** through the **CCINP competitive exam**, with an average score of 14.14. Not outstanding, but enough to secure my first-choice school.  

I found Phelma particularly appealing for its focus on materials science and nuclear engineering, even if my teachers advised me to aim “higher.” Once there, I realized how diverse the student body was: many came from different CPGE tracks, some had repeated years (*“5/2”*), and others came from star classes. This diversity made me question the hierarchy often presented in the French system.  

I also heard from Centrale students that their programs leaned more toward management than technical depth, reinforcing my view that preparatory classes are often designed more as a competition for prestige than as a training ground for engineering expertise.

### Reflection

While preparatory classes were tough, they gave me resilience, strong fundamentals in physics and math, and the ability to work under pressure. More importantly, they helped me define what I value in my studies: not just prestige, but **real technical knowledge and meaningful projects**.
