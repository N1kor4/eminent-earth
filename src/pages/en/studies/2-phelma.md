description: My three years at Phelma taught me more than just physics. From nanofabrication labs to quantum research, I discovered how theory becomes technology — and realised that I want to help build the future of quantum computing.

## Engineering Degree in Quantum Physics, Nanophysics and Microelectronics

Joining Phelma – Grenoble INP was one of the biggest changes in my life. Moving 800 km from home, I had to start from scratch — but thanks to the strong student community and especially the Student Office, integration was much easier than expected. Grenoble quickly became a second home. While engineering school is definitely not a vacation, these years have been both intense and deeply rewarding.

## First year

The first year at Phelma is split into several tracks. During the first semester, students choose between PMP (Physics and Materials Processes) and PET (Physics, Electronics, and Telecom). In the second semester, both groups can move toward an intermediate program such as PI (Physics Instrumentation).

This structure reflects Phelma’s history: it was formed from three different schools, and that diversity is still present in the range of courses. In practice, students must pick a preliminary specialization early on.

I initially followed the PMP path with the goal of entering the highly selective GEN (Nuclear Engineering) program. Around a third of the promotion had the same ambition, making competition intense. Due to my strong involvement in the Student Office, I wasn’t able to secure a spot and instead joined my second choice: IPHY (Physics, Microelectronics, and Photonics).

At first, it was disappointing. But looking back, it turned out to be the right decision: the courses matched my interests better, and it opened the door to new opportunities. In fact, it laid the foundation for the rest of my academic journey.

## Second year

Starting IPHY, I was still processing the change, but I quickly adapted thanks to great classmates and engaging courses. I even began to appreciate subjects I used to dislike — for example, electronics, which I had struggled with in preparatory classes, suddenly made sense when taught through real-world applications: noise theory, filtering stages, and the physics of components.

Semiconductors, once just endless equations, came alive when explained through use cases and material behavior. Similarly, materials science felt abstract until we studied how structures affect properties, and how combining them enables entirely new devices. It was like unlocking a new video game: no longer coding the rules, but finally playing with them.

That year, I had the chance to:
- Work in a cleanroom and explore nanofabrication.
- Join quantum lab sessions that deepened my interest in quantum technologies.
- Contribute to a collaborative project with CEA-Leti, where our team built an Arduino/Python device for testing new ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM) prototypes. This was a hands-on and highly motivating experience.
- Create a nice video with classmates : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvNvOv0hjls.

The year ended with my first research internship at EPFL Neuchâtel, which confirmed my enthusiasm for combining physics, microelectronics, and quantum engineering.

## Third year

After the second year, students can specialize in one of three master’s tracks: microelectronics, pure quantum mechanics, or a hybrid path oriented toward quantum computing. While the term “computing” can be debated, this program offered the perfect balance between device physics and quantum information. I chose it as part of a double degree with Université Grenoble Alpes (UGA).

It has been an incredible opportunity to learn alongside researchers from CEA-Leti, Institut Néel (CNRS), and start-ups like Quboly and Silent Waves. Being exposed to both academic and industrial experts has shaped my vision of the field and reinforced my ambition to contribute to quantum technologies.

## Looking Ahead

I am now pursuing this path with the goal of gaining further hands-on experience in quantum computing, superconducting devices, and advanced nanofabrication. I am currently looking for an internship in this domain, eager to apply what I’ve learned and continue exploring the technologies that will drive the next generation of computation.
