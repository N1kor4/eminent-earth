## Discovering quantum physics in the lab

During my second year at Phelma, I had the chance to move beyond equations and simulations and actually touch some of the **fundamental experiments of quantum physics**.  

Up until then, concepts like photon statistics or entanglement felt very abstract — fascinating on paper, but still distant. Being in the lab, aligning mirrors and detectors, and actually *seeing* the physics happen made everything much more real.

### Photon bunching & anti-bunching

This was my first direct look into the strange world of photons. By measuring correlations between detection events, we could tell if light was behaving as a classical wave (bunching) or showing its true quantum nature (anti-bunching). It was striking to see how statistics reveal behavior that no single measurement could.

### Michelson & Mach-Zehnder interferometry

Setting up these interferometers reminded me that **quantum mechanics often hides in plain sight**. By adjusting just a mirror by a fraction of a wavelength, interference patterns appeared and disappeared. It was a very visual way to connect wave–particle duality to real, controllable setups.

### Quantum entanglement (basic lab scale)

Probably the highlight of the practicals. With a fairly compact setup, we generated and measured **entangled photon pairs**. Even if it was on a small scale, it was hard not to think about how the same principles are used in quantum communication experiments worldwide.  

---

### Polarization qubit encoding

Finally, we encoded information in the polarization state of photons, treating them as **qubits**. This was my first step into quantum information: understanding how a physical property can carry information in a way that classical bits never could.

## Reflection

These practicals may have been simple compared to what’s done in research labs, but for me they were a **turning point**. They connected abstract theory to real optical benches, and made me realize that quantum mechanics is not just equations on paper — it’s something you can build, measure, and play with.
