description: A selection of small coding and simulation projects done during my studies, ranging from physics modeling to fun programming exercises.

## Overview

Not all projects need to be huge research ones â€” some of the most useful (and fun) were small exercises during classes. They were opportunities to **learn new tools, test ideas quickly, and explore different ways of thinking**. You can find all my projects on my Github page : https://github.com/N1kor4. Here are a few highlights:

---

### Angle of a droplet (Python)

A short project in fluid mechanics: measuring and simulating the **contact angle of a water droplet** on a surface. It introduced me to image analysis and how physics meets coding.  

---

### Tetris Game (Python)

A playful side project: coding a Tetris game from scratch, later made **playable directly in a browser window**. It was less about reinventing the wheel and more about improving my logic, structuring a project, and getting a first taste of interactive applications.  

---

### MATLAB simulations

- **Electromagnetic waveguide** modeling  
- **Magnetic train** levitation study  

These were my first steps using MATLAB for physics, and I enjoyed how fast it can turn equations into actual simulations.  

---

### LabVIEW initiation

Small-scale scripts to get started with **LabVIEW**, mainly for simple data acquisition and instrument control. A useful introduction to graphical programming for labs.  

---

### Python utilities

Automation scripts for **plotting and data processing**. Nothing too fancy, but incredibly practical when working with repetitive experimental results.

## Reflection

These projects may not be "big" in scope, but they were **building blocks**: each one taught me something new, whether it was physics, coding, or simply a smarter way of solving problems. They also shaped the way I approach bigger projects later on.
