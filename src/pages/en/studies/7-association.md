## Managing a €200k student organization budget

As **Treasurer of Phelma’s Student Office (BDE)**, I oversaw the financial operations of the school’s largest student associations, coordinating **over €200,000** in funds and supporting the execution of more than **20 major events** across the academic year.

My mission was to ensure transparent and efficient management of the budget, while supporting the logistical, administrative, and strategic needs of the team. I worked closely with event leads, vice-presidents, and school administration.

## Reflections & skills developed

This experience strengthened key engineering skills:
