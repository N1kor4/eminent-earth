## Intro

Privacy is something I've been interested in for a long time. Back in high school, I managed to install a custom boot on my phone. If you're not familiar with what a boot is, let's just say I installed Linux (CalyxOS) instead of Windows (Android) on my computer (phone).

My parents were a bit confused:  
**"So you're telling me you're trying to avoid GAFAM, but you just bought a Google Phone?"**

Yeah — and that's why I thought I'd write a bit about privacy and why I find it so important nowadays.

My concern about privacy didn’t come out of nowhere. I’ve always been interested in tech and exploring all the possibilities of the modern devices we only seem to use for watching videos. Our smartphones and computers — even 10 years ago — were incredibly powerful. When COVID-19 hit, there were real concerns about privacy and ethics, especially around the COVID pass we had in France.

Obviously, looking back, it's hard to fairly judge decisions made in such a chaotic time. But it still felt like being tagged. There were even comparisons in TV shows to how surveillance works in China. That’s what sparked my personal journey toward better privacy.

I wasn’t into the conspiracy theories we saw during the pandemic, but I started questioning:  
- How is my data managed?  
- Who knows what about whom?  
- Why are all these services free?  
- Why do social media platforms keep me hooked?

I started becoming more skeptical. Thankfully, after doing some research, I found a few great YouTube channels I highly recommend:

- **Techlore** – for tech tools and advice  
- **The Hated One** – deep dives into privacy issues  
- **Mental Outlaw** – great mix of tech and privacy content  
- **Side of Burritos** – super clear explanations

There are many more, but these are still my go-tos.

Of course, it’s impossible to talk about privacy without mentioning **Edward Snowden**. He inspired me — someone who risked everything just to reveal the truth. That's when I fully realized how easy it is for governments and scammers to target our devices and personal accounts.

But why is privacy important, you might ask?

Well, it really depends on you.  
Some people say:  
**"If you’ve got nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear."**  
To which Snowden famously replied:  
**"Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say."**

Taking steps to reduce your dependence on GAFAM or government-controlled systems is a first step toward resisting unchecked globalism and capitalism.
