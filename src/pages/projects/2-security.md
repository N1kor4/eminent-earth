Practices you’ve learned: 2FA, firewalls, SSH, password managers
Mention small things like configuring fail2ban, UFW, or securing SSH access

## Intro

This is kind of a supplementary talk about privacy. Indeed, if you have read my text on privacy, you should know the basic.
Security is what balance privacy. Indeed, the more you depend on yourself, the more likely you'll make mistakes and probably lose some data. You are not an IT guy, you are not working h24 on your computer to make things working (I hope). But it's still something you should care about.
What is the point on avoiding GAFAM which have very secure very intrusive security (they sell your data but an outsider will have hard time getting that infromations without paying for it - it's very precious) if you've been hacked over a public network ?

This text is more about how can you harden you devices and network to better enhance your security and be less an easy target.
