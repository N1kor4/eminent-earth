## Lycée Chateaubriand, Rennes

After obtaining my high school diploma (BAC) with highest honors, I followed the advice of my physics teacher, who agreed with my math teacher, to embark on the journey of preparatory classes. Arriving with quite some confidence because I had passed the BAC fairly easily without much effort, I was soon faced with the infamous "prépa wall." It was the beginning of an experience that would leave me with many lasting memories.

I only learned later that there are other paths to enter engineering schools, which is also a criticism that should be made about the French education system. Equal chances are supposedly given to all students through Parcoursup, but knowledge about alternative routes (integrated preparatory classes, cross-disciplinary DUT or bachelor’s programs) remains somewhat limited.

Why Chateaubriand? Well, I had the choice between this school and Clémenceau in Nantes, both close to home. Initially, I wanted to pursue the PSI (Physics and Engineering Science) track, which was better ranked. One of my best friends made the same choice, so it was quite natural that we would end up there together.

However, I did not quite follow the path I initially envisioned, eventually choosing the PC (Physics-Chemistry) track. Preparatory classes are demanding, and while I appreciate that they motivate students to always aim higher and give their best, I think smaller specialized schools are sometimes neglected in favor of larger schools that mainly produce managers rather than experts (looking at you, Centrale).

Preparatory classes impose a fast pace on students, and Saturday morning exams add significant stress. The curriculum is very dense, allowing us to put theory into practice through labs and TIPE projects, although the main motivation remains pure, often theoretical knowledge.

There is also the concept of "star classes" that group the best students from the first-year tracks. I narrowly missed being in this group by two places (out of 24 students), and I am glad I wasn’t included because I feel I expressed my knowledge better in a class where I was part of the top half. Additionally, the atmosphere was less stressful.

In the end, I succeeded in entering Phelma through the CCINP competitive exam with an average score of 14.14—not outstanding, but enough to choose the school I wanted within the CCINP network.

I found Phelma particularly interesting for its focus on materials science and nuclear engineering, even if my teachers advised me to aim "higher."

When I started at Phelma, I realized that students came from very different backgrounds, as previously mentioned, including many repeating students (“5/2”) and some from star classes. This made me question everything we are told about preparatory classes. Furthermore, from what I heard from people who went to the Centrale schools, they focus more on management than on real engineering subjects. This made me question even more the value of preparatory classes, which ultimately seem like a competition to send the most students to these so-called "elite" schools, without focusing on what really matters in engineering: technical skills.
